                                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our
                                    origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his
                                    theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our
                                    place in this world.</p>
                                <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have
                                    evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who
                                    didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs
                                    too.</p>

                                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering

                                    improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of
                                    exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major
                                    breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.

                                <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also
                                    from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
